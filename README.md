# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the github flow.

My name is Simon, and I am a student and tenant in Pasadena, CA. I hope to build many useful projects in the coming months and years!

I have worked with HTML, CSS, JS, Python, and Java. My current goal is to design and stand up a database complete with an application interface!
